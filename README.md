# Analyzing no show appointment data 

This dataset is collected from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focusing on whether patients show up for their appointment or not.

## Questions we are trying to answer:

1 - What is the overall rate of appointment show-up vs no show-up?

2 - What are the most feature that effects the show-up?

## Project steps:

1 - Data Wrangling

2 - Exploratory Data Analysis

3 - Conclusions
